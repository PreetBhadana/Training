		admine --- rwx  4 + 2 + 1 = 7
		group  --- rw   4 + 2     = 6

	1.2 -- cp <file1> <file2> (copy file one into file2 and if not present then create file)
	1.3 -- cp <file1> <dir1 at same location> (copy file in at same located directory) 
	1.4 -- cp <file1> <fil2> <dir at same location> (same as above but copy both file)
	1.5 -- By Absolute and relative path
		cp ../test.txt ../test2.txt .
		(Relative path file copy at relative path(. is for current location and .. is for just one level back location))
		cp ../test.txt ../test2.txt /home/beryl/Desktop/Preet
		(relative path to absolute path)
	1.6 -- Resurcive --
		1. cp -r <dir1> <dir2> (dir2 not exist)
		   (make dir2 and copy dir1's all inside file to dir2)
		2. cp -r <dir1> <dir2> (dir2 is not exist)
		   (copy dir1 directory in dir2)
	1.7 cp -vr dir1 dir2 (is show with processing details like first which one is copping and then which one)




2) Scp --- Secure copy same as cp
	2.1 -- $ scp <filename> <host name>@<ip of server>:<path where want to save>
	2.2 -- for directory---
	  $ scp -r <directory> <host name>@<ip of server>:<path where want to save>
	2.3 -- By diffrent port number then ssh -22
	scp -r <dir> <host name>@<ip of server>:<path where want to save> -P 1234
