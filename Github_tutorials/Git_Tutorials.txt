---- Git Tutorial ----

On terminal ----

$ sudo apt-get install git (to install git)

(Create repository on github and follow these steps on terminal)

$ git config --global user.name "PreetBhadana"
$ git config --global user.email "preetbha@gmail.com"
$ git config --list (check the added details like name and email)

(this same thing also can check by going home directory)
$ gedit .gitconfig
(here you can find all details what you added above)

(Create a folder from where you want to upload the fies and then go in that folder by cd command on terminal)

$ echo "# Trainning" >>README.md
$ git init
$ git add README.md
(here in add command we can also use)
	$git add . (this will auto detect the add file which need to add or not 
			added yet)
$ git commit -m "First comit"
$ git branch -M main
$ git branch add origin <url of your git repository>
$ git push -u origin main
$

Now if want to add any file on github repository----

(First of all add that file in same directory where we init and add remote origin link)

$ git status (to check status of our folder that which file need to upload that 
		will show in red color) 
$ git add <file name>
$ git status (to check that is ready to upload and will see that file in green 
		color)
$ git comit -m "Comment"(Comment is what ever you want to give details about the
			file)
$ git push -u origin main (main is branch name you should add what every your 
				name is)
(then it ask for username like PreetBhadana)
(then it ask for password do add what is your github password)

(file added successfully!!!)
