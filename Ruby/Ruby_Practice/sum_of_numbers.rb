# Sum of two numbers in ruby ---

a = 4
b = 6
c = a + b
puts "the sum of #{a} #{b} is #{c}"
print("the sum of #{a} #{b} is #{c}")

#Notes --- Difference between in puts and print is just simple as in puts the cursur will start from next line and in print the cursure will be in same line on thime of execution.
