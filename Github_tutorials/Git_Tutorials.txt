---- Git Tutorial ----

On terminal ----

$ sudo apt-get install git (to install git)

(Create repository on github and follow these steps on terminal)

$ git config --global user.name "PreetBhadana"
$ git config --global user.email "preetbha@gmail.com"
$ git config --list (check the added details like name and email)

(this same thing also can check by going home directory)
$ gedit .gitconfig
(here you can find all details what you added above)

(Create a folder from where you want to upload the fies and then go in that folder by cd command on terminal)

$ echo "# Trainning" >>README.md
$ git init
$ git add README.md
(here in add command we can also use)
	$git add . (this will auto detect the add file which need to add or not 
			added yet)
$ git commit -m "First comit"
$ git branch -M main
$ git branch add origin <url of your git repository>
$ git push -u origin main
$

Now if want to add any file on github repository----

(First of all add that file in same directory where we init and add remote origin link)

$ git status (to check status of our folder that which file need to upload that 
		will show in red color) 
$ git add <file name>
$ git status (to check that is ready to upload and will see that file in green 
		color)
$ git comit -m "Comment"(Comment is what ever you want to give details about the
			file)
$ git push -u origin main (main is branch name you should add what every your 
				name is)
(then it ask for username like PreetBhadana)
(then it ask for password do add what is your github password)

(file added successfully!!!)

##Some More git commands ----

$ git help <verb> (verb is like commit, config, add etc)
$ git config --help (work as same as above one)
$ git add --help (help manual of help)

# To remove file from staging area ----

$ git reset <filename>
$ git reset (this command will remove all files from staging area)

[Notes]---
"Message should be detailed about any specific changes made so far"


#To see last commit ----

$ git log (show all commits)
$ git log -2 (it will show last 2 commits and this command can be modified by any number form 1 - any)


#To clone any repository ----

$ git clone <url> <path where you want this repository clone>
$ git clone <url> (it will clone repo at present location)


# To view information about remote repo ----

$ git remote -v (it will show fetch and push urls)
$ git branch -a (it will show all branch names local and remote both)


# To check what changes made in code ----

$ git diff 


# Diffrence between Pull and Push ----

$ git pull (pull is to pull any change made after clone or made by me so far) 

$ git push (push means to update the remote repository what the changes made so far in the main data or code)


# Create a new branch ----

$ git branch <new branch name>

( to check branch )

$ git branch (it will show all local branchs only)
or
$ git branch -a (it will show all local and remote branchs in list)


# To change to the other branch ----

$ git checkout <branch name> (branch name must be the other branch name which is not using now)


# To push via new branch to remote repository ----

$ gir push -u origin <new branch name> (can be push after using the new branch only if we will on other branch then ot will show error)



## Merge a branch in to master branch ----

1) $ git checkout Master 

2) $ git pull origin Master (to pull all update to merge branch)

3) $ git branch --merged (to checked as list which branch is merged)

4) $ git merge <other branch name> (this branch name must be othe branch which need to be merge in master branch and first we need to checkout at master branch as well)

5) $ git push origin Master (now the all changes has been pushed to the master branch on the remote repo)

[Note]---
(As now er merged the other branch to master branch then need to delete that newly merged branch)
first of all we need to delete local branch

6) $ git branch -d <branch name>
(to make change in the remote branch we need to push that branch to remote repo)

7) $ git branch -a (from this we get know which branch is still as remote branch)

8) $ git push origin --delete <branch name need to delete>
(by this command the remote brench will delete)




Example --- as summary ----

1) create branch --
$ git branch <branch name>

2) Swap to this brnach name to use it ---
$ git checkout <branch name>

3) check status ---
$ git status

4) add file which has been not added ---
$ git add <file name>

5) commit this tracked file ---
$ git commit -m "detailed message what changes made"

6) push through new branch ---
$ git push -u origin <new branch>

 --- Now let merger to master branch ---

7) swap to the master branch ---
$ git checkout Master

8) pull all update via master branch ---
$ git pull origin Master

9) Now Merge other branch to Master brnach ---
$ git merge subtract (subtract is other branch which is going to merge in master branch)

10) check the merged branches ---
$ git branch --merged

11) Now push those all changes to remote Repo ---
$ git push origin Master

12) Now delete the other branch locally first ---
$ git branch -d subtract 

13) check branch deleted or now and also check the remote branch ---
$ git branch -a

14) delete remote branch from remote repository ---
$ git push origin --delete <remote branch name>


Now we can make new branch and merge it to master branch !!!!
